Hi, I'm Sander van Rijn. I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Leiden University with interests in Natural Computing Algorithms, Machine Learning, Clean Code and Open Science practices.

This is my attempt at a personal blog. I'll probably just be posting small code snippets or timing experiments here. This should serve as some public memory for myself, and maybe it can help someone else too.

This site is made using [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/)


You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
